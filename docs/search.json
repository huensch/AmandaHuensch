    "text": "I am Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh. I teach courses in second language acquisition, pronunciation pedagogy, and quantitative research methods. I am currently Associate Editor for Open Science of Applied Psycholinguistics.\nMy research examines second language speech development in and outside of the classroom, including the relationship between speech perception and production, fluency development, and the relationships among inhibitory control, domain-general auditory processing, and L2 perception/production skills.\nMy most recent work has been published in Language Learning, Studies in Second Language Acquisition, and TESOL Quarterly. I received my PhD in Linguistics and Second Language Studies from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
