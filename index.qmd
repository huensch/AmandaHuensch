:::{#me}

I am Assistant Professor in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh. I teach courses in second language acquisition, pronunciation pedagogy, and quantitative research methods. I am currently Associate Editor for Open Science of [Applied Psycholinguistics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/applied-psycholinguistics).

My research examines second language speech development in and outside of the classroom, including the relationship between speech perception and production, fluency development, and the relationships among inhibitory control, domain-general auditory processing, and L2 perception/production skills.

My most recent work has been published in Language Learning, Studies in Second Language Acquisition, and TESOL Quarterly. I received my PhD in Linguistics and Second Language Studies from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
